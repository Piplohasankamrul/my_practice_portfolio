         <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>  
         <p>As part of my roles & responsibilites as a web developer at company x, I was responsible for developing the website and revamping it as per the needs & requirements. My efforts led to a 40% increase in mobile users and 50% increase in user clicks. This led to a subsequent increase in purchase of services by 30% which dramatically increased the sales efforts of the company. I was also responsible for recruiting and mentoring a team of junior developers whom I personally mentored to ensure the timely delivery of my team. I was also responsible for training over 20 developers in internal web functions such as updating websites and fixing bugs</p>
